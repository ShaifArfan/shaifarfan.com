Generally, there are several techniques for rendering HTML in the browser. These frontend development methods can often feel overwhelming. Therefore, having a visual representation of these methods can be highly beneficial. Below is a list of key techniques for rendering HTML.

1. MPA - (Traditional Multiple Page Application)
1. Basic SPA - (Single Page Application)
1. SPA with SSR - (Single Page Application with Server Side Rendering)
1. SPA-influenced isomorphic (Server Rendered)
1. MPA influenced split execution (Island/Server Component)

All the diagram are created by me from the [video of Theo](https://youtu.be/Cifkb-ZVps4), with my own improvisations.

### 1. MPA - (Traditional Multiple Page Application)

**Pros**:

1. Good for SEO, since first load will have complete HTML
1. Less complexity

**Cons**:

1. No immediate navigation.
2. HTML file completely generated from the server. So, no CDN benefits here.

### 2. Basic SPA - (Single Page Application)

**Pros**:

1. You get the immediate navigation on page change.

**Cons**:

1. Initial HTML file will be empty, which not gonna work with SEO.
1. You need to store the big chunk data on the client side to generate the pages.
1. The first load can take time because many tasks need to be completed during it

### 3. SPA with SSR - (Single Page Application with Server Side Rendering)

**Pros**:

1. You get the immediate navigation on page change.
2. First load will have full HTML content, which is good for SEO
3. User will see content faster than traditional SPA way.

**Cons**:

1. You still need to store the big chunk data on the client side to generate the pages.
2. You can't get the HTML from CDN, since we will generate it from the server.

### 4. SPA-influenced isomorphic (Same code runs differently on client and server)

**Pros**:

1. You get the immediate navigation on page change.
2. First load will have full HTML content, which is good for SEO
3. User will see content faster than traditional SPA way.

**Cons**:

1. You still need to store the big chunk data on the client side to generate the pages.
1. You can't get the HTML from CDN, since we will generate it from the server.

### 5. MPA influenced split execution (Island/Server Component)

![MPA influenced split execution](https://res.cloudinary.com/shaifarfan/image/upload/v1737119785/shaifarfan.com/blog/all-the-ways-to-render-html-in-the-browser/split-execution_kibtde.png)

**Pros**:

1. You can store the HTML file wherever you want (CDN, S3 etc.)
2. Less complexity

**Cons**:

1. To get the island content you need wait for the static HTML to get back from the server first.

Thank you for taking the time to explore this guide! I hope the diagrams made understanding these HTML rendering methods easier.
