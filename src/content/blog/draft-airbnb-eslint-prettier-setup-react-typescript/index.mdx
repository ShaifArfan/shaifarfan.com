## 01. Create project & setup initial Eslint

First, create a project using React & TypeScript. You can use any framework or tool you want. For this example, I will be using `Vite` with TypeScript.

Let's create a project using Vite.

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

This will already install `eslint` & create `eslintrc` file, which we will not use. We will set up ESLint manually.

If you don’t have ESLint installed, first you need to install ESLint by:

```bash
npm i -D eslint
```

Once we have ESLint in our project, we can start ESLint setup by running this command:

```bash
npm init @eslint/config
```

This will ask some questions that we need to answer based on the project you are working on.

```txt
✔ How would you like to use ESLint? · problems
✔ What type of modules does your project use? · esm
✔ Which framework does your project use? · react
✔ Does your project use TypeScript? · No / Yes
✔ Where does your code run? · browser
✔ What format do you want your config file to be in? · JavaScript
```

After that, based on your answers, it will ask you to install some packages. You can choose "yes" and also select which package manager you want to use to install them.

It will generate a new `eslintrc` file, which will replace the existing one if we have any. Since we chose the format of the config file to be `JavaScript`, the file name will be `.eslintrc.cjs` or `.eslintrc.js` based on your project.

## 02. Adding `Airbnb` ESLint Style Guide

### Adding `eslint-config-airbnb`

```bash
npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb
```

Once we have installed this, we need to extend the config in `eslintrc` file.

```jsx
extends: ["airbnb", "airbnb/hooks"]
extends: ["airbnb-base"] //for non react project
```

### Adding `eslint-config-airbnb-typescript`

Enhances Airbnb's ESLint config with TypeScript support

```bash
npm install eslint-config-airbnb-typescript \
            @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@^7.0.0 \
            @typescript-eslint/parser@^7.0.0 \
            --save-dev
```

> If you are installing it in the future, make sure to check the latest recommended version [here](https://github.com/iamturns/eslint-config-airbnb-typescript?tab=readme-ov-file#2-install-dependencies-and-peer-dependencies)

Once we have installed this, we can extend `airbnb-typescript` in our `eslintrc` file.

```js
extends: [
  'airbnb',
  'airbnb-typescript', // [!code ++] //airbnb-typescript/base' for non react
  'airbnb/hooks'
]
```

Also, we need to add the `@typescript-eslint/parser` and add the tsconfig file path to `parserOptions.project` in our `eslintrc` file.

```js
parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser",
parserOptions: {
   project: "./tsconfig.json", // path of tsconfig file
}
```

Also, include the `eslintrc` file in our `tsconfig.json` file.

```json
"include": [
	".eslintrc.cjs" // path of  eslintrc file
]
```

## 03. Adding `Prettier` to our project.

```bash
npm install -D prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
```

After the installation, we need to extend it in our `eslintrc` file.

```js
extends: [
  ..., // all the other extends,
  "plugin:prettier/recommended" // this should be the last one
]
```

Now for our Prettier configurations, we need to create a file called `.prettierrc.cjs`. Now you can add your Prettier rules in this file.

```js
module.exports = {
  trailingComma: 'es5',
  tabWidth: 2,
  semi: true,
  singleQuote: true,
};
```

## 04. Adding Scripts & Editor Configurations

That’s it. Now you can add these two scripts to your `package.json` to find ESLint errors and fix them.

```json
"lint": "eslint .",
"lint:fix": "eslint . --fix",
```

**ℹ️** Try to reload the code editor if you face any unexpected issues.

### For VS Code

For VS Code, you can install [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) & [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extensions to take more advantage.

Once you have these two extensions, you can add these settings in your `.vscode/settings.json` or you can add them in your global settings.

```json
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  }
```

Now you don’t need to run lint scripts to fix errors manually. The extensions will automatically fix all the auto-fixable errors on save.
