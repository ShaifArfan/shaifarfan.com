## Welcome to the Blog Section of the Website

I'm really excited to begin this blog journey. I will be sharing my insights and learnings, and I hope you will find them helpful.

First of all, this website is completely open source. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/shaifarfan/shaifarfan.com). Feel free to explore the repository and contribute ðŸš€.

I created this website mainly using `Astro` and `TailwindCSS`. I thoroughly enjoyed building the website and learned a ton about Astro.js. While the website is not yet complete, I will be adding more features in the future. Even in the blog section, I need to incorporate additional features like pagination, search functionality, tags, and estimated reading time. But for now, I believe it's a good start.

Moving forward, I will be writing blog posts alongside my YouTube videos. I believe this will be helpful for viewers to gain a deeper understanding of the topics covered and will allow me to share more insights.

Now, let's discuss how I created this website, specifically the blog section.

As mentioned, I primarily used `Astro.js` and `TailwindCSS`. For the blog, I used MDX.

For those unfamiliar, MDX is a file format that allows you to use JSX in your Markdown files. This enables you to create more dynamic content by using `React.js` within your markdown files.

### Tech Stack Used

- Astro.js
- TailwindCSS
- MDX
- React.js

When I began building this blog, I found [Astro's tutorials](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/) very helpful.

There are multiple approaches to create a blog using Astro.js. I used the [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) feature to organize the blog posts. This feature allows you to define a schema for the frontmatter of the blog posts, ensuring type safety.

Now, let's discuss how I enhanced the aesthetics and user-friendliness of the blog content.

- **@tailwindcss/typography**: For styling the blog content
- **shiki**: Code syntax highlighting (default in Astro)
- **shikiji-transformers**: Code highlighting (line highlighting, diff highlighting, etc.)
- **rehype-external-links**: Customizing external links
- **rehype-slug**: Adding IDs to the headings
- **rehype-autolink-headings**: Adding anchor links to the headings

When it comes to content, images play a significant role. Fortunately, Astro.js has a built-in [`<Image />`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#image--astroassets) component, which will help you to diplay optimized images.

For image hosting, I decided not to host images locally but instead remotely hosted them on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).

That's it for today. I will be adding more content in the future. If you have any suggestions, feel free to reach out to me.
