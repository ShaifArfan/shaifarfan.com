## Welcome to the blog section of the website

I am really excited to start my blog journey. I will be sharing my insights and learnings. I hope you will find it helpful.

First of all, This website is completely open source. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/shaifarfan/shaifarfan.com). Explore the repogitory and feel free contributeðŸš€.

I made this website using mainly `Astro` & `TailwindCSS`. I really anjoied building the website & learned a ton about astro.js. The website is not complete yet, I will be adding more features in the future. Even in the blog section, I need to add some more features like pagination, search, tags, read time etc. But right now, I think it's a good start.

From now on, I will be writing blog posts along side my YouTube videos, I think which will be helpfull for the viewers to understand the topic more deeply. And also will allow me to share more insights.

Now, How i created this website specially blog Selection.
As i said, I used `Astro.js` & `TailwindCSS` mainly. For Blog i used MDX with that.

For those who don't know, MDX is a file format that lets you use JSX in your Markdown documents. So, you can use `React.js` inside your markdown file which will allow you to create more dynamic content.

### Tech Stack Used

- Astro.js
- TailwindCSS
- MDX
- React.js

When i started building this blog, i found [Astro's tutorials](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/) very helpful.

There are many ways to create a blog using Astro.js. I used [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) feature to create the blog posts. Which allow you create schema for the frontmatter of the blog posts which will be type safe.

Now, what i used to make it more beautiful and user friendly.

- **@tailwindcss/typography** - For styling the blog content
- **shiki** - Code syntax highlighting (default in Astro)
- **shikiji-transformers** - Code highlighting (line highlighting, diff highlighting, etc)
- **rehype-external-links** - Customizing external links
- **rehype-slug** - Adding id to the headings
- **rehype-autolink-headings** - Adding anchor links to the headings

I will be adding more stuff in future. If you have any suggestions, feel free to reach out to me.
